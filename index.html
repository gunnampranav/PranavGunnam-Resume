        <p class="lead mb-4"Enter Bio here<br><br>

       I was born in Fremont, California on August 11,2002. I went to American High School and pursued my interests in business since 9th grade. I joined DECA and self studied many subjects pivotal to the business area such as Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, and Finance. I also started a club at high school called the Statistics Club. I was the head manager of the Marketing Division and was in charge of advertising the new app we were developing for our school and to make effective presentations to our princiapls and other head members of the school district.
      <br><br>

       Most of my current work experience comes from the company ReadyEdgeGo. This is a company that mostly engages with high school and college students and helps guide them through high school with mentorships and college applications help. I was a client to this company in 2019 when I was applying to colleges in the fall. Later in 2020, my counselor offered me a job as his assistant. I have been trained mostly in customer engagement and onboarding. I answer calls and emails from potential clients and engage them with our services and help onboard them to purchasing our products.In addition to this, I have also been trained with marketing on a platform called Mailchimp. I have been trained to use Canva, a website used to make fliers and advertisments and then post them on Mailchimp to send to our subscribers. I do this when we offer new products or certain discounts in our company. After sending our fliers, I also view our statistics such as who viewed our flier, when they viewed it, and how many signed up after it was sent. I then find new ways to advertise effectively based on this data.Last but not least, I have worked on jumpstarting a Youtube channel with our CEO and other employees to expand our company and to provide all non-subscribers some advice and knowledge about who we are. I have helped design the Yotube page, as well a advertising every new video we have released.
       
       Other than academics, I am committed to my family owned startup business called Creative Collections. I help draft emails and help with making terms and conditions with customers to avoid any possible future conflicts. Our company brings specially carved furniture from jaipur, India and sells them in our warehouse located in San Francisco. I am currently working on helping my parents with marketing our startup and raising awareness about the business by posting ads on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Along with marketing, I am also working on developing the company website with my father in HTML so customers can see an updated version of what's in stock and what special deals are going on during the holiday season.
